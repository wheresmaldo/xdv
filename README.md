CLEAR Project Demo - Dynamic Viewing

Over that last decade, American sports viewership has experienced a plateau in onboarding new viewers. To combat this, offer a Dynamic Viewing (DV) sports feature that allows the users to dynamically switch video feeds of their choice during a live sports event. This would significantly change the way sports fans experience live events. A user will be able to tune to specific video cameras that are strategically placed throughout the stadium, all via remote, desktop, or mobile screen. This would provide a unique POV experience that doesn’t exist in video streaming today.
